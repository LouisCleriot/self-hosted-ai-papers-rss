&lt;li&gt;Not even that. They're making the conscious decision to double down on fossil fuels, and the environmental damage caused by mining for them. They're actively choosing to make things worse than they were already going to be.  (Upvotes: 85)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Comment 3:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rollbacks in clean energy incentives in Republicans’ budget planswill put the brakes on U.S. greenhouse gas emissions reductions by throttling the growth of renewables and electric vehicles, analyses from four research firms showed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extent of the Republican cuts is still being determined as the House takes up the Senate version of the GOP budget legislation. But early modeling by research groups shows the bill that passed Tuesday in the Senate would lift emissions of carbon dioxide by 8 to 12 percent from levels expected over the next decade if Democrats’ climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act (H.R. 5376 (117)), remained in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That figure is close to the 8 to 11 percent increase over the same period under the bill passed last month by House Republicans, according to figures calculated by the Rhodium Group. Those estimates don’t take into account the impacts the Trump administration’s regulatory actions would have on the carbon dioxide emissions released from power plants and tailpipes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Joe Biden pledged to cut greenhouse gases 61 to 66 percent below 2005 levels by 2035 — a target his administration said was needed to keep the world’s climate from careening further off track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These [bills] push those goals far out of reach,” said Jesse Jenkins, a Princeton University professor who runs the Rapid Energy Policy Evaluation and Analysis Toolkit that modeled the effects of the bills&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just for the record, when the Social Security program was started there was concern that the SSN identifier would escape it's purpose of being your retirement fund identifier to become a national identifier.  Specific language was introduced into the authorization for the program to prevent this from happening.  The creators of the program were concerned about the government facilitating a dictator like Orwell's "Big Brother," a character shaped by the world's 1940's exposure to fascism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an official version of Windows 11 LTSC (long term support) for corporations that have thousands of existing Windows 10 PC hardware that does not meet TPM requirements, sold and supported by Microsoft itself but they refuse to sell to consumers. They are also offering a free 1 year extension of Windows 10 support but you have to make an account on their servers. Both of these seem to be clear abuses of their user community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Comment 1:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all know the excuse they're using is absolutely bullshit. If they're undercover or something then don't deploy them in the field for this work. And why are almost all of them wearing masks and un-ID'ed? Are they all doing undercover work now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Privacy? More bullshit. Regular cops don't have to hide their faces and badge numbers to do their job. This is purely to prevent any accountability whatsoever. You can't report any of these agents for anything when you can't ID them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine if Biden did this shit. Imagine if he had agents checking people for vaccine status or mask wearing or whatever the right wing get antsy about. I remember the MAGA conspiracies about FEMA camps rounding up people. They seemed to hate that imaginary squads of Federal agents were rounding up people but they're cool with it now. It's always projection with these assholes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EDIT: To those claiming ICE agents were getting doxxed, the DHS report from the Trump administration has refused to give out specific numbers for their claims. Only saying that assaults and doxxing against ICE agents went up 413%. Without actual numbers that could be anything from 5 to 5000 assaults or whatever.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EDIT EDIT: Also the excuse for no badge numbers is bullshit even if fear of doxxing is legitimate. Other LEO agencies have personal information separate from ID numbers to prevent retaliation. But with no badge number, citizens have no way to report anything. This should concern EVERYONE.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EDIT 3. Since someone commented that I'm whining about "ICE just doing their job enforcing a law that's been in place for centuries":&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The issue brought up here isn't that ICE is enforcing immigration laws, it's that they're breaking the law to do it and abusing their power. And they are making it so that it's impossible to hold ICE accountable for any wrongdoing or illegal activity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And expedited removal with no due process  used to be restricted to "point of entry" where ICE agents had the authority to forgo due process to deport someone at point of entry. ER back then was much less prone to abuse and error since it was literally catching someone crossing illegally and sending them back.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That power has now been  expanded to the entire country now and to anyone they deem to be an illegal. No due process. How can you think that is not a horrible idea?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man… it’s just wild watching republicans support this. And the new budget will give them more money than any law enforcement agency has ever had in the history of the world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The have created a secret police force - complete with hidden identities, funding for prisons (where the cruelty of the conditions are a selling point), authorization to ship people to foreign prisons, orders to examine de-naturalization, threats against opposition politicians, and obstruction charges for anyone who even asks about warrants or authorization. The creation of huge AI databases collecting all of the biometric data on everyone here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s quite literally creating the framework for widespread population control. More prison space than we would ever need. Faceless, nameless police who can do whatever they want to you if their handlers say so. People who had legal protections have been taken and shipped away. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re about to test if we’re actually the home of the brave, because we’re going to need a lot of bravery. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you build a gun like this - to the tune of billions of dollars - do you think they won’t use it? Do you think you’ll be safe?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why would you ever give any government this kind of power? What is “conservative” about that? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s just shocking how gleeful so many appear to be about this when there’s been decades of messaging about fear of the government centralizing power against people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;They’re planning to use the gun against minorities. They can’t see further than that.  You would think Afghanistan and Iraq and Syria would have been enough of an object lesson in what happens to a country when you have armed groups roaming around without oversight.

&lt;li&gt;Only 14 other countries, not including us, spend more on their MILITARY than this bill would appropriate to ICE. It’s fucking insane (Upvotes: 80)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Well the bill passed apparently. So once they are done building the prison camps and the DOGE database of the citizens is completed, they can start rounding up anyone who voted democrat or who &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; vote democrat and send them into the void, without charges, without due process, without accountability etc. Its a dictator's dream for the GOP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: To add that I am a Canadian, so this isn't my fight, it's yours. I support those US citizens who support the rule of law and the US Constitution. I would never advocate violence, but sadly I think that with the direction things are heading, it may be inevitable. I will hope that the current President oversteps the line enough to wake up even his supporters and his support and power are eroded. Its very sad to see the US in this situation.

&lt;p&gt;They're government employees, and more than that they're law enforcement officers, so fuck them. They don't like having their names and faces plastered all over the place, quit and find a new job. There's no way we'd put up with some traffic cop wearing a facemask to hide their identity or refusing to give us their name and badge number if demanded, why should we accept it from ICE?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The question you ask is just rhetorical though. All US police forces are operating by their own rules at this point, at least materially. 
Unless there is some type of radical change brought about, “the people” simply do not have a lever to operate that would or could stop any federal agents from hiding their identities. 
Even in your scenario, what are any of us going to do about the masked traffic cop? Unless an unelected official decides on their own to make changes, we won’t see any. (Upvotes: 47)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nah. You'd put up with that too. (Upvotes: 8)

&lt;p&gt;Are they, though?  I thought a large number were actually just bounty hunters making citizens arrests and collecting a fee. (Upvotes: 6)&lt;/p&gt;
