**Today's Core Themes & Summaries:**
{themes_and_summaries}

**Your Process:**
1.  **Synthesize the Narrative:** What is the single most important story today? For example, is it about AI autonomy, architectural efficiency, or a new mode of human-computer interaction?
2.  **Choose a Core Visual Metaphor:** Translate this narrative into a strong central image. Avoid clich√©s like generic networks. Think bigger: 'a crystalline city growing organically from raw data', 'a tapestry woven from light and logic', 'the ghost in the machine rendered as a beautiful, complex aurora'.
3.  **Select a Unique Art Style:** Choose a compelling and specific artistic style. Examples: Biopunk, Art Deco Futurism, Abstract Technical Illustration, Surrealism, Digital Collage, Solarpunk.
4.  **Compose the Prompt:** Combine the metaphor and style into a single, highly-detailed sentence for the FLUX.1 image model. Specify colors, textures, and mood.

**Output Format (single-line JSON):**
{{"generation_prompt": "A detailed, artistic prompt describing the hero image..."}}

**Example:**
{{"generation_prompt": "An art deco-inspired digital painting of a colossal, intricate clockwork brain, with gears made of shimmering data and iridescent circuits, set against a dark, dramatic background, conveying a sense of powerful, controlled intelligence and order."}}
